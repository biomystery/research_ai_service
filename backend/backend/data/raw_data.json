    "content": "Sterile inflammation, resulting from hepatocyte death and subsequent release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), significantly contributes to liver disease pathogenesis. Neutrophils, as primary responders to liver injury, undergo NETosis - an immune response generating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), further amplifying inflammatory damage. Extracellular DNA (ecDNA), a major constituent of NETs and released cell fragments, potentiates inflammation through pattern recognition receptor activation. Mitochondrial DNA, released during hepatocyte damage, especially provokes robust immune responses due to its bacterial DNA-like structure and unmethylated CpG motifs. Concurrently, purinergic signaling - particularly via ATP release and its conversion into adenosine by ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 - critically modulates immune homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Dysregulated expression of CD39/CD73, driven by altered aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling, exacerbates inflammatory states through disturbed regulatory T (Treg) and T helper (Th) 17 cell balance. Recent insights highlight that neutrophils and NETs not only drive innate inflammatory responses but significantly influence adaptive immunity by modulating T cell differentiation. NET components, such as cathelicidin and histones, actively promote Th17 differentiation while simultaneously impairing Treg functions, thereby sustaining inflammatory conditions. Additionally, T cells reciprocally influence neutrophil activation and recruitment, predominantly through IL-17A production. Detailed mechanisms underlying neutrophil-T cell crosstalk in autoimmune hepatitis, acute liver failure, ischemia/reperfusion injury, alcoholic liver disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease underscore potential therapeutic targets. Future strategies targeting NET formation, ecDNA clearance via DNase therapy, purinergic receptor modulation, and restoring AhR signaling hold promise for effectively attenuating sterile inflammation and immune dysregulation in liver diseases.",

    "content": "A serious side effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is known as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in which the recipient's body is attacked by donor immune cells, leading to a high rate of morbidity and death. Although there are several therapies available for GvHD, their efficacy is limited, and they sometimes have serious adverse effects. Recently, one of the most interesting research in the field of cell therapy is the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have been investigated in the treatment of HCT and its consequences such as GvHD, due to their potential in tissue repair and immunomodulatory activities. The potential negative consequences of direct cell transplantation are avoided by using MSC-EVs, which are micro vesicles packed with physiologically active materials like proteins, microRNAs, and other nucleic acids. One of the biggest advantages of MSC-EVs is their ability to dramatically alter immune cell responses in GvHD by delivering immunomodulatory chemicals and anti-inflammatory drugs to recipient cells. Some of the significant discoveries include encouraging the differentiation of pro-inflammatory macrophages into tissue-reparative macrophages, inhibiting the generation of inflammatory cytokines, and improving the function of regulatory T-cells. This study details the effects of MSC-EVs on the multiple alterations that occurred inside host cells as well as immunomodulation mediated by both T cells and antigen-presenting cells in terms of the immunopathology of GvHD and direct regenerative effects on damaged tissues.",

    "content": "Cellular therapies aim to treat or manage disease by introducing living cells that integrate into the host and restore or eliminate dysfunctional tissues. Despite their promise for clinical success, the host immune response to cellular treatments remains a challenge since traditional approaches for abrogating immune rejection involve systemic immunosuppression, which results in severe off-target toxicity. One alternate strategy for restraining immune responses involves harnessing the natural immunomodulatory capabilities of regulatory T cells (Tregs), a specialized subset of T cells that suppress inflammatory immune responses and can promote induction and maintenance of transplant tolerance. Here we propose using the NanoLymph platform, an implantable subcutaneous device for continuous localized recruitment of Tregs, to achieve immunological tolerance free of systemic immunosuppression. The NanoLymph features a dual-reservoir system for the sustained release of immunomodulatory agents through a nanoporous membrane and a vascularized compartment that supports cell homing and allograft integration with the host. This work demonstrates robust vascularization of the NanoLymph by four weeks post-implantation, along with sustained in vivo elution of immunomodulatory agents for up to one month that selectively recruit and expand Tregs. Finally, we demonstrate that NanoLymph prolongs cell persistence in a bioluminescent allogeneic transplant model. Overall, the NanoLymph represents a versatile platform to generate a safe and localized tolerogenic microenvironment relevant for cell transplant therapies.",

    "content": "The efficacy of anticancer treatments, including radiotherapy, depends on the activation of type I IFN signaling. However, its regulatory networks and mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that tumor cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling can be transferred to macrophages via secretory autophagy, inducing CXCL9hi macrophages and enhancing CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, K63-linked ubiquitination at the K167 site of phosphorylated STAT2 (p-STAT2) facilitates its binding to LC3B, promoting the loading of p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 into extracellular vesicles and intercellular transference from tumor cells to macrophages, which, however, is suppressed by USP5-mediated STAT2 deubiquitination. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of USP5 promotes autophagy-dependent unconventional protein secretion of p-STAT1 and p-STAT2, leading to the induction of CXCL9+ macrophages. This process promotes the expression of T cell chemokines and upregulates the antigen presentation machinery, thereby enhancing radiation-induced CD8+ T cell antitumor immunity and radiotherapy efficacy. Our findings reveal a critical role of USP5 in type I IFN-induced antitumor immunity, providing potential targets for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy.",

Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current treatment along with blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, it has not been feasible to specifically target inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects.

    "content": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) remain highly prevalent and are associated with a reduced quality of life in affected patients. The pathophysiology of IBD is multifactorial since genetic predisposition, altered immune function, changes in intestinal microbiota, environmental factors, and loss of intestinal barrier function together induce disease manifestation. A critical key factor is the dysregulation of the immune system which explains that all medical therapeutic approaches target the immune response. However, the success of these therapies is limited and associated with severe side effects which demonstrates the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Previous research demonstrated that CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are important regulators of intestinal homeostasis but are reduced in number and function relative to effector T cells in IBD. This led to the concept that genetically engineered, antigen-specific Tregs may represent a promising strategy to address immune dysregulation in IBD. Due to their antigen specificity, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) enable additional target-dependent activation and migration of Tregs at disease sites. While CARs are increasingly established for the generation of antigen-specificity for T cell therapies in cancer, the implementation of CARs for IBD is in a preliminary state. Nonetheless, CAR constructs specific to circulating carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), flagellin, or IL23R have been developed recently for potential application in IBD. Based on these novel developments, this review will discuss the role of Tregs in IBD disorders and present the current state of CAR Treg models.",

Gut microbial composition and derived metabolites influence immune homeostasis and autoimmunity. This review summarizes recent advances elucidating immune dysregulations in T1D and novel therapeutic strategies to preserve beta cell function. We discuss approaches such as immune cell engineering, including CAR-Treg therapy, and targeted modulation of immune signaling pathways like JAK-STAT. Furthermore, we explore the role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in modulating host immunity and describe emerging microbiome-targeting interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation and metabolite supplementation. These interventions show promise in modulating disease progression in preclinical and early clinical studies. An integrated understanding of immune and microbiome-related mechanisms is critical for developing next-generation therapies.

Despite the recent advances in surgery and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate of PC continues to be less than 10%.

In our study, on the basis of our previous research, we use anti-MSLN CAR-T as effector cell and explore the different effects and mechanism of gut microbiota (PC or healthy control) on anti-MSLN CAR-T treatment. Firstly, we detect the differences of gut microbiota and T cell cholesterol metabolism in PC and healthy control by means of 16S-rRNA,PCR, western blot and ELISA; explore the different effects of gut microbiota on the subtype of T cells; and analyze the relationships between intestinal flora composition and T cell cholesterol metabolism or subtype changes by means of Spearman's correlation. Secondly, we also explore the different effects of gut microbiota on the proliferation, migration, subtype, inflammatory cytokines expression and anti-tumor effector function of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells by means of flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assay. Thirdly, we discuss the different expression of cholesterol esterification enzyme 1 (ACAT-1) and other core genes of cholesterol metabolism in anti-MSLN CAR-T. Lastly, we evaluate the effects of different gut microbiota on the treatment of PC by anti-MSLN CAR-T cells in NSG mouse model of subcutaneous PC transplantation and liver metastasis. Through the above experiments, a new theoretical basis is provided in which gut microbiota regulates the subtype and anti-tumor function of anti-MSLN CAR-T by ACAT-1 expression.

    "content": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) are autoimmune diseases characterized by immune-mediated damage to the central nervous system. Current treatments primarily focus on chronic immunosuppression. Immune tolerance induction offers a novel approach to restoring immune balance while minimizing systemic side effects. Central and peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms regulate autoreactive lymphocytes, ensuring immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways underpins NMOSD and MOGAD pathogenesis. Antigen-specific therapies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantigens include peptide-based vaccines and nanoparticle delivery systems, promoting T cell anergy and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion. Cell-based therapies utilizing ex vivo-expanded Tregs or regulatory B cells (Bregs) have shown promise in preclinical models but face challenges in clinical translation due to scalability and safety concerns. Gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 present opportunities to modulate immune pathways and restore tolerance, although delivery and off-target effects remain obstacles. Additionally, strategies addressing double-seronegative NMOSD, which lacks detectable autoantibodies, emphasize broad immune modulation rather than antigen specificity. While significant progress has been achieved, the transition to clinical application requires overcoming hurdles such as optimizing antigen delivery, ensuring long-term efficacy, and identifying reliable biomarkers. Advances in personalized medicine hold promise for achieving sustained remission, reducing dependency on immunosuppression, and improving patient outcomes in NMOSD and MOGAD. This review explores advancements in tolerance strategies, highlighting their potential in NMOSD and MOGAD.",

    "content": "The only curative treatment for end-stage renal disease is through kidney transplantation. Solid organ transplants success had been made possible by the development of Immunosuppressive (IS) drugs. However, the long-term survival of transplants is still shortened by the chronic dysfunction of the graft which is not prevented by current IS regimens. Moreover, these IS drugs increase the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies, and have many non-immune side-effects that hamper their tolerability.\n\nNew research strategies are, therefore, developed with the aim of reducing the dependence on conventional pharmacological IS drugs. Regulatory cell therapy is one of these strategies. It consists of expanding specific populations of immune regulatory cells ex vivo into cell-based drugs that can then be infused into transplant recipients, with the goal of inducing graft tolerance.\n\nThis is the framework of this clinical trial. The experimental drug \"Eight Treg\" being evaluated in this study is an autologous cell therapy product containing CD8+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) expanded ex vivo during 21 days of cell culture. Team 2 of the Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology (CR2TI), Nantes University, INSERM, Mixed Research Unit (UMR) 1064, responsible for developing the manufacturing process of the experimental drug \"Eight Treg\", has demonstrated the feasibility of the expansion of CD8+ Tregs ex vivo and their ability to prevent skin graft rejection and inhibit Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) in NOD-Scid-IL-2\u03b3-/- mouse models (NSG)14.\n\nBased on the preclinical experience of CR2TI team 2, which has been working on basic and translational aspects of CD8+ Tregs for 15 years, the present phase I clinical trial aims to assess the safety of increasing doses of the experimental drug \"Eight Treg\" in 9 recipients of renal transplantation from a living donor. The possibility of manufacturing the experimental drug \"Eight Treg\" at the required doses, in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Process (GMP), has been assessed in validation runs as specified at the end of the \"justification of the study\" part of this protocol. This clinical trial will be the first administration of expanded CD8+ Tregs into humans, and it follows previous studies which evaluated the safety of other regulatory cell therapy products, containing expanded CD4+ Tregs and other regulatory cells (autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells performed by Nantes CHU laboratory and clinical services, for example), injected into patients in different contexts (renal transplantation, liver transplantation, GVHD, type 1 diabetes, etc) without causing any significant adverse effect. This study will pave the way for future, broader research on the use of CD8+ Tregs as a possible anti-rejection and tolerance inducer \"drug\" in transplantation.",

    "content": "This is a Phase I/II non-randomized clinical trial of ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene transfer treatment for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID, also known as SCID-X1) using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector incorporating additional features to improve safety and performance. The study will treat 35 patients with XSCID who are between 2 and 50 years of age and who have clinically significant impairment of immunity. Patients will receive a total busulfan dose of approximately 6 mg/kg/body weight (target busulfan Area Under Curve is 4500 min\\*micromol/L/day) delivered as 3mg/kg body weight on day 1 and dose adjusted on day 2 (if busulfan AUC result is available) to achieve the target dose, to condition their bone marrow, and this will be followed by a single infusion of autologous transduced CD34+HSC. Patients will then be followed to evaluate engraftment, expansion, and function of gene corrected lymphocytes that arise from the transplant; to evaluate improvement in laboratory measures of immune function; to evaluate any clinical benefit that accrues from the treatment; and to evaluate the safety of this treatment. The primary endpoint of the study with respect to these outcomes will be at 2 years, though data relevant to these measures will be collected at intervals throughout the study and during the longer follow-up period of at least 15 years recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance \"Long Term Follow-Up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products\" https://www.fda.gov/media/113768/download for patients\n\nparticipating in gene transfer clinical trials.\n\nXSCID results from defects in the IL2RGgene encoding the common gamma chain (yc) shared by receptors for Interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. At birth XSCID patients generally lack or have a severe deficiency of T-lymphocytes and NK cells, while their B- lymphocytes are normal in number but are severely deficient in function, failing to make essential antibodies. The severe deficiency form of XSCID is fatal in infancy without intervention to restore some level of immune function. The best current therapy is a T-lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow transplant from an HLA tissue typing matched sibling, and with this type of donor it is not required to administer chemotherapy or radiation conditioning of the patient's marrow to achieve excellent engraftment and immune correction of an XSCID patient. However, the great majority of patients with XSCID lack a matched sibling donor, and in these patients the standard of care is to perform a transplant of T- lymphocyte depleted bone marrow from a parent. This type of transplant is called haploidentical because in general a parent will be only half- matched by HLA tissue typing to the affected child. Whether or not any conditioning is used, haploidentical transplant for XSCID has a significantly poorer prognosis than a matched sibling donor transplant. Following haploidentical transplant, XSCID patients are observed to achieve a wide range of partial immune reconstitution and that reconstitution can wane over time in some patients. That subset of XSCID patients who either fail to engraft, fail to achieve adequate immune reconstitution, or lose immune function over time suffer from recurrent viral, bacterial and fungal infections, problems with allo- or autoimmunity, impaired pulmonary function and/or significant growth failure.\n\nWe propose to offer gene transfer treatment to XSCID patients\\^3 \\>= 2 years of age who have clinically significant defects of immunity despite prior haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and who lack an HLA-matched sibling donor. Our current gene transfer treatment protocol can be regarded as a salvage/rescue protocol.\n\nPrior successful retroviral gene transfer treatment instead of bone marrow transplant (BMT) in Paris and London for 20 infants with XSCID has provided proof of principle for efficacy. However, a major safety concern is the occurrence of 5 cases of leukemia at 3-5 years after treatment triggered in part by vector insertional mutagenesis activation of LMO2 and other DNA regulatory genes by the strong enhancer present in the long-terminal repeat (LTR) of the Moloney Leukemia Virus (MLV)- based vector.\n\nFurthermore, previous studies of gene transfer treatment of older XSCID patients with MLV- based vectors demonstrated the additional problem of failure of adequate expansion of gene corrected T- lymphocytes to the very high levels seen in infants. To reduce or eliminate this leukemia risk, and possibly enhance performance sufficiently to achieve benefit in older XSCID patients, we have generated a lentivector with improved safety and performance features. We have generated a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector that is devoid of all viral transcription elements; that contains a short form of the human elongation factor 1a (EF1a) internal promoter to expres...",
