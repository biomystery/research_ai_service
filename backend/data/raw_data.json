    "title": "Exploring the Immunomodulatory Role of Forkhead Box Protein 3 (FOXP3) in the Pathophysiology of Neuropsychiatric Disorders.",
    "content": "Neuropsychiatric disorders represent a diverse range of conditions, such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with shared immunological and neuroinflammatory signatures. The key immunomodulatory role of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), the master transcription factor for developing and maintaining regulatory T cells (Tregs), has been highlighted in recent research in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. This review integrates evidence of FoxP3 expression and dysregulation correlating with the development and evolution of neuropsychiatric disorders. We discuss FoxP3's molecular architecture, physiological roles, and its growing role in controlling neuroinflammation and immune homeostasis. We discuss further the complex network of signaling pathways-JAK-STAT, IL-2/STAT5, TGF-\u03b2/SMAD, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, AMPK, NF-\u03baB, and Notch-controlling or controlled by FoxP3 based on both preclinical and clinical evidence. It is suggested by research that modulation of these pathways impairs FoxP3 expression and Treg function, thus modifying neuroimmune homeostasis and neuropsychiatric outcome. The interaction of FoxP3 with STAT5 or SMAD3, for example, increases the suppressive potential of Treg, whereas PI3K/Akt or Notch signaling-dependent suppression of FoxP3 helps in immune deregulation. Inclusion of FoxP3 into the neuroimmune model provides an attractive paradigm through which to consider and therapeutically address immune dysfunction in neuropsychiatric illnesses. This review identifies FoxP3 as a likely biomarker and therapeutic target, opening the way for novel immunomodulatory approaches for the treatment of these incapacitating diseases.",

    "title": "Can Immune Checkpoint Modulation Redefine Ocular Immunotherapy? Emerging Mechanisms, Challenges, and Translational Opportunities-A Comprehensive Review.",
    "content": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, and their application is now expanding to various conditions, including prevalent medical issues such as uveal melanoma, autoimmune uveitis, and surface squamous neoplasms. The unique immunological challenges in these cases arise from the immune-privileged nature of the eye, which employs immune evasion mechanisms that often lead to an advanced disease at diagnosis. Recent breakthroughs in immune checkpoints have identified critical regulatory molecules, such as PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and CEACAM1, which are pivotal in modulating ocular immune responses. The use of novel immunotherapeutic strategies to block these pathways presents new opportunities to treat ocular and inflammatory eye disorders. T-cell exhaustion (Tex) is a significant hurdle in ocular immunotherapy that results in immune dysfunction because of prolonged antigen exposure. Strategies to counteract Tex, including combination therapies that pair PD-1 inhibitors with co-stimulatory agonists such as OX40 and CD137, have shown promise in preclinical murine models. Additionally, dual blockade targeting TIM-3 alongside PD-1 has been found to enhance T-cell responses. An integrated approach targeting multiple pathways may yield improved therapeutic outcomes in eye diseases characterized by immune dysregulation. However, several challenges remain in optimizing immune checkpoint therapies for ocular conditions. Future research should prioritize dual objectives: (1) developing IL-10/TGF-\u03b2-promoting therapies to mitigate immune-related adverse events (e.g., retinal vasculitis) and (2) validating LAG-3 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as biomarkers for predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor response in uveal melanoma. It is essential to explore effective combinations of checkpoint inhibitors, determine the optimal timing for their use, and establish better criteria for patient selection. As research on immune checkpoint therapies progresses, they have the potential to transform the management of ocular diseases, offering innovative treatment options for patients who previously had limited choices.",

    "content": "Cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis is responsible for 18 million deaths annually, highlighting a significant need for new medical therapies, especially for patients who are not eligible for percutaneous interventions. Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the accumulation of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current treatment along with blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, it has not been feasible to specifically target inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been used to treat cancer, resolve cardiac fibrosis, and restore immune balance in autoimmune diseases. In some instances, T regulatory cells endowed with CAR (CAR Tregs) have been developed to treat autoimmunity through antigen-specific immunosuppression.",

    "content": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a recently discovered subpopulation of immunosuppressive T cells critical for sustaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. Depending on the disease, Tregs can alter immune responses by exerting their effects on various immunological functions. Evidence reveals that altered Treg homeostasis plays an important role in the development and progression of several central nervous system (CNS) diseases in humans. There have been positive outcomes in trials aimed at restoring Treg balance, but their clinical success has been limited. This could partly be due to a lack of an animal model to recapitulate the complex immune alterations that occur as the disease progresses. Therefore, there is a need for naturally occurring, immune-competent disease models to serve as the next critical step in translating therapy from murine models to human clinical trials. Several CNS diseases have canine analogs due to high inter-species homology of molecular signatures and clinicopathologic features. Human multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, glioblastoma, and meningioma parallel canine granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME), canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), high-grade glioma (HGG), and canine meningioma, respectively. In addition, pet dogs share the same living environment and therefore may offer a compelling model faithfully recapitulating these diseases. This review discusses the current knowledge of Treg homeostasis and dysregulation mechanisms within canine CNS diseases, their analogous diseases in humans, and the ongoing clinical trials aimed at restoring normal Treg function. Collectively, comparative translational research investigating Treg homeostasis is needed to bridge well-designed pre-clinical canine studies with early-phase human clinical trials, ultimately benefiting the health of both species.",

    "content": "Brief Scientific Rationale:\n\nDecitabine has been shown to be effective for treatment of MDS and associated with very limited extramedullary toxicity at the lower doses. Furthermore, the hypomethylating effects of decitabine require an extended period of therapy and are likely to be more beneficial in the setting of a minimal residual disease after transplantation. The drug might exert a cytoreductive effect on the MDS clone, but ex vivo expansion strategy using decitabine and HDAC inhibitor provides a potential to expand the number of hematopoietic stem cells. There are lots of evidence which showed the the drug have immunostimulatory effects and can be used to enhance graft-versus leukemia effects. And also, some investigator suggested that decitabine could induce FOXP3 expression, promoting the conversion of na\u00efve T cells to Tregs which are known to suppress GVHD while maintaining GVL effect in allo-SCT setting. As such, decitabine is an ideal agent to be investigated in the post-transplant setting.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that post-transplant maintenance therapy with decitabine may reduce relapse rate, which may maximize the beneficial effects from reduced TRM of ATG-containing FB4 or FB2 conditioning regimen in higher-risk MDS or AML evolving from MDS patients.",

    "content": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) remain highly prevalent and are associated with a reduced quality of life in affected patients. The pathophysiology of IBD is multifactorial since genetic predisposition, altered immune function, changes in intestinal microbiota, environmental factors, and loss of intestinal barrier function together induce disease manifestation. A critical key factor is the dysregulation of the immune system which explains that all medical therapeutic approaches target the immune response. However, the success of these therapies is limited and associated with severe side effects which demonstrates the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Previous research demonstrated that CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are important regulators of intestinal homeostasis but are reduced in number and function relative to effector T cells in IBD. This led to the concept that genetically engineered, antigen-specific Tregs may represent a promising strategy to address immune dysregulation in IBD. Due to their antigen specificity, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) enable additional target-dependent activation and migration of Tregs at disease sites. While CARs are increasingly established for the generation of antigen-specificity for T cell therapies in cancer, the implementation of CARs for IBD is in a preliminary state. Nonetheless, CAR constructs specific to circulating carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), flagellin, or IL23R have been developed recently for potential application in IBD. Based on these novel developments, this review will discuss the role of Tregs in IBD disorders and present the current state of CAR Treg models.",

Current treatments primarily focus on chronic immunosuppression. Immune tolerance induction offers a novel approach to restoring immune balance while minimizing systemic side effects. Central and peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms regulate autoreactive lymphocytes, ensuring immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways underpins NMOSD and MOGAD pathogenesis. Antigen-specific therapies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantigens include peptide-based vaccines and nanoparticle delivery systems, promoting T cell anergy and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion.

In this study, we sought to alleviate the core symptoms of autism by addressing immune dysregulation, especially T-cell subpopulation imbalances, in BTBR mice through low-dose IL-2 (LdIL-2) treatment. LdIL-2 (30,000\u2009IU) was administered subcutaneously, and changes in autistic behaviors were observed before and after treatment. Behavioral assessments included the three-chamber test, self-grooming test, sniffing test, marble burying test, open field test and Y-maze test. We also examined alterations in peripheral Th/Treg ratios, cytokine levels, and M1/M2 microglia ratios in the central nervous system via flow cytometry. Neuroinflammatory proteins in cerebrospinal fluid were assessed using proteomic analysis. Furthermore, CD25",

Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) activates and expands Tregs in humans.\n\nHence, Ld IL-2 in patients in whom the autoimmune process was blocked early by a short treatment (2 months) of cyclosporine should restore immune homeostasis and maintain some insulin production over the long term.",
