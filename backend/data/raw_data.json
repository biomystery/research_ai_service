    "content": "Gastric cancer remains a major clinical challenge due to its propensity for metastasis and poor five-year survival rates. Emerging evidence implicates chronic psychological stress as a critical promoter of tumor dissemination. Stress signals engage both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), leading to sustained elevations of cortisol and catecholamines. These mediators act on glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2) in gastric cancer cells, thereby activating downstream cAMP/PKA and NF-\u03baB/STAT3 pathways. The resulting cascade enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), upregulates matrix metalloproteinases, and promotes neovascularization, while concurrently inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by CD8\u207a T-cell exhaustion, M2-polarized TAMs, and Treg expansion. Moreover, stress-driven epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming amplifies the Warburg effect and synergizes with Helicobacter pylori infection to accelerate tumor invasion. Clinical and cohort studies consistently associate elevated stress markers with increased metastasis risk, and interventions-ranging from \u03b2-blockers and GR antagonists to cognitive-behavioral therapy-show promise in mitigating these effects. Future advances in multi-omics, spatial profiling, smart probiotics, and optogenetic tools are poised to unravel the complex \"stress-tumor\" interface and enable precise, integrative mind-body therapeutic strategies.",

However, the observation that autoreactive T-cell activation and disease progression can occur without B cells challenges this view. Still, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that B-cell depletion alleviates \u03b2-cell destruction, suggesting a critical role for B cells in T1D. Our findings propose an alternative function for B cells, impairing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that would otherwise protect islets. In the NOD islet transplant model, we show that B-cell absence enables transplant tolerance, allowing Tregs to become responsive to immune therapy and confer allograft protection. Extending this to spontaneous diabetes, we have found that insulin-reactive Tregs are reduced in NOD mice in proportion to insulin-reactive B cells, while effector T cells remain unaffected. Moreover, Tregs from B-cell-deficient NOD mice better restrained \u03b2-cell destruction than those from B-cell-sufficient environments. Together, these findings indicate that autoreactive B cells primarily erode immune regulation by culling islet-protective Tregs. Thus, therapies that mobilize Tregs could be more effective when combined with B-cell-targeting strategies in islet transplant or T1D prevention.",

    "content": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) remain highly prevalent and are associated with a reduced quality of life in affected patients. The pathophysiology of IBD is multifactorial since genetic predisposition, altered immune function, changes in intestinal microbiota, environmental factors, and loss of intestinal barrier function together induce disease manifestation. A critical key factor is the dysregulation of the immune system which explains that all medical therapeutic approaches target the immune response. However, the success of these therapies is limited and associated with severe side effects which demonstrates the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Previous research demonstrated that CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are important regulators of intestinal homeostasis but are reduced in number and function relative to effector T cells in IBD. This led to the concept that genetically engineered, antigen-specific Tregs may represent a promising strategy to address immune dysregulation in IBD. Due to their antigen specificity, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) enable additional target-dependent activation and migration of Tregs at disease sites. While CARs are increasingly established for the generation of antigen-specificity for T cell therapies in cancer, the implementation of CARs for IBD is in a preliminary state. Nonetheless, CAR constructs specific to circulating carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), flagellin, or IL23R have been developed recently for potential application in IBD. Based on these novel developments, this review will discuss the role of Tregs in IBD disorders and present the current state of CAR Treg models.",

We discuss approaches such as immune cell engineering, including CAR-Treg therapy, and targeted modulation of immune signaling pathways like JAK-STAT. Furthermore, we explore the role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in modulating host immunity and describe emerging microbiome-targeting interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation and metabolite supplementation. These interventions show promise in modulating disease progression in preclinical and early clinical studies.

Despite the recent advances in surgery and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate of PC continues to be less than 10%.

In our study, on the basis of our previous research, we use anti-MSLN CAR-T as effector cell and explore the different effects and mechanism of gut microbiota (PC or healthy control) on anti-MSLN CAR-T treatment. Firstly, we detect the differences of gut microbiota and T cell cholesterol metabolism in PC and healthy control by means of 16S-rRNA,PCR, western blot and ELISA; explore the different effects of gut microbiota on the subtype of T cells; and analyze the relationships between intestinal flora composition and T cell cholesterol metabolism or subtype changes by means of Spearman's correlation. Secondly, we also explore the different effects of gut microbiota on the proliferation, migration, subtype, inflammatory cytokines expression and anti-tumor effector function of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells by means of flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assay. Thirdly, we discuss the different expression of cholesterol esterification enzyme 1 (ACAT-1) and other core genes of cholesterol metabolism in anti-MSLN CAR-T. Lastly, we evaluate the effects of different gut microbiota on the treatment of PC by anti-MSLN CAR-T cells in NSG mouse model of subcutaneous PC transplantation and liver metastasis. Through the above experiments, a new theoretical basis is provided in which gut microbiota regulates the subtype and anti-tumor function of anti-MSLN CAR-T by ACAT-1 expression.

    "content": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of allogeneic CD6 chimeric antigen receptor T regulatory cells (CD6-CAR Tregs) in treating patients who have chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). An allogeneic HCT is an established treatment for benign or malignant blood and marrow conditions where healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into a patient to help the patient's bone marrow make more healthy cells and platelets. GVHD is a systemic disorder that occurs when the graft's immune cells recognize the host as foreign and attack the recipient's body cells. \"Graft\" refers to transplanted, or donated tissues, and \"host\" refers to the tissues of the recipient. It is a common complication after allogeneic HCT. The onset of cGVHD is usually within three years of transplantation and has some features of autoimmune diseases. A strategy that minimizes the incidence and severity of cGVHD, without other adverse effects, is needed to improve survival after allogeneic HCT. T regulatory cells are critical for controlling autoimmunity and maintaining immune homeostasis. Patients with active cGVHD have reduced numbers of T regulatory cells compared to patients without GVHD, suggesting that restoration of T regulatory cells in patients with active cGCHD is impaired and insufficient numbers may contribute to cGVHD. Therefore, therapies that augment numbers and function of T regulatory cells may promote tolerance and control of cGVHD. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which T cells (a type of immune system cell) are taken from the blood and changed in the laboratory. The gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, CD6, on the patient's cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. CD6-CAR Tregs combines the CD6-targeted anti-inflammatory response with the immune regulatory properties of T regulatory cells which could generate a more potent and stable T regulatory cell population to promote immune tolerance and long-term disease control in cGVHD.",

    "content": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) are autoimmune diseases characterized by immune-mediated damage to the central nervous system. Current treatments primarily focus on chronic immunosuppression. Immune tolerance induction offers a novel approach to restoring immune balance while minimizing systemic side effects. Central and peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms regulate autoreactive lymphocytes, ensuring immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways underpins NMOSD and MOGAD pathogenesis. Antigen-specific therapies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantigens include peptide-based vaccines and nanoparticle delivery systems, promoting T cell anergy and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion. Cell-based therapies utilizing ex vivo-expanded Tregs or regulatory B cells (Bregs) have shown promise in preclinical models but face challenges in clinical translation due to scalability and safety concerns. Gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 present opportunities to modulate immune pathways and restore tolerance, although delivery and off-target effects remain obstacles. Additionally, strategies addressing double-seronegative NMOSD, which lacks detectable autoantibodies, emphasize broad immune modulation rather than antigen specificity. While significant progress has been achieved, the transition to clinical application requires overcoming hurdles such as optimizing antigen delivery, ensuring long-term efficacy, and identifying reliable biomarkers. Advances in personalized medicine hold promise for achieving sustained remission, reducing dependency on immunosuppression, and improving patient outcomes in NMOSD and MOGAD. This review explores advancements in tolerance strategies, highlighting their potential in NMOSD and MOGAD.",

    "title": "Eight-Treg Study: a Phase I Dose Escalation Trial of Adoptive Immunotherapy With Autologous ex Vivo Expanded Regulatory CD8+ T Cells in Living Donor Kidney Transplant Recipients",
    "content": "The only curative treatment for end-stage renal disease is through kidney transplantation. Solid organ transplants success had been made possible by the development of Immunosuppressive (IS) drugs. However, the long-term survival of transplants is still shortened by the chronic dysfunction of the graft which is not prevented by current IS regimens. Moreover, these IS drugs increase the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies, and have many non-immune side-effects that hamper their tolerability.\n\nNew research strategies are, therefore, developed with the aim of reducing the dependence on conventional pharmacological IS drugs. Regulatory cell therapy is one of these strategies. It consists of expanding specific populations of immune regulatory cells ex vivo into cell-based drugs that can then be infused into transplant recipients, with the goal of inducing graft tolerance.\n\nThis is the framework of this clinical trial. The experimental drug \"Eight Treg\" being evaluated in this study is an autologous cell therapy product containing CD8+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) expanded ex vivo during 21 days of cell culture. Team 2 of the Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology (CR2TI), Nantes University, INSERM, Mixed Research Unit (UMR) 1064, responsible for developing the manufacturing process of the experimental drug \"Eight Treg\", has demonstrated the feasibility of the expansion of CD8+ Tregs ex vivo and their ability to prevent skin graft rejection and inhibit Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) in NOD-Scid-IL-2\u03b3-/- mouse models (NSG)14.\n\nBased on the preclinical experience of CR2TI team 2, which has been working on basic and translational aspects of CD8+ Tregs for 15 years, the present phase I clinical trial aims to assess the safety of increasing doses of the experimental drug \"Eight Treg\" in 9 recipients of renal transplantation from a living donor. The possibility of manufacturing the experimental drug \"Eight Treg\" at the required doses, in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Process (GMP), has been assessed in validation runs as specified at the end of the \"justification of the study\" part of this protocol. This clinical trial will be the first administration of expanded CD8+ Tregs into humans, and it follows previous studies which evaluated the safety of other regulatory cell therapy products, containing expanded CD4+ Tregs and other regulatory cells (autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells performed by Nantes CHU laboratory and clinical services, for example), injected into patients in different contexts (renal transplantation, liver transplantation, GVHD, type 1 diabetes, etc) without causing any significant adverse effect. This study will pave the way for future, broader research on the use of CD8+ Tregs as a possible anti-rejection and tolerance inducer \"drug\" in transplantation.",
