Read the Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/agents-intensive-capstone-project.

I am an advanced bioinformatician and data scientist specializing in Treg cell therapy, with expertise in full stack development (LIMS, pipelines, CMC data portals), microservices, systems biology, and programming languages including R, Python, Matlab, Shell, and React. I have approximately 2 weeks part-time available for this project.

Considering my background and time constraints, generate at least 3 feasible project ideas for completing this capstone competition. For each idea, provide a clear, concise rationale linking it to my skills and estimated effort required.

Present the ideas and prompt me to select one to proceed with.

After I confirm, create a detailed implementation plan with key milestones covering:
- data preprocessing and integration steps,
- modeling and algorithm selection aligned with the competition objectives,
- evaluation criteria and validation methods.

Pause for my approval before initiating any code generation or automated execution.

1) please double check if current implementation meets the requirements in the competition page.
2) enable google genmini api as default option
3) particularly i think there is a requrement of using google ADK, please double check if current implementation meets this requirement.
